A major difference between selection in cancer and selection at the human population level is that, in cancer, only a single cell type is subject to selection whereas, in an organism, selection can occur via dysfunction of any cell type. Furthermore, in cancer, damaging mutations may be more tolerated owing to dysfunction in the normal apoptotic process. Previous studies, including those of Weinhold et al.7, show that the rate of mutation in intergenic regions is greater than in coding and regulatory regions. Our analysis suggests that the observed differences in mutation rate can be explained largely, if not entirely, by potential false positive mutations from mapping errors and by differences in mutation rate relating to base-pair type and replication timing.

Sequencing coverage calculations. Sequencing coverage was calculated from VarScanSomaticSNP output. This output gives cancer and normal read counts for all potential germline and somatic variants. The <u>median coverage</u> for each cancer and normal sequencing sample was determined by taking the median coverage of these variants.
