Application of DNase I footprinting to the study of in vivo interactions has proven difficult, and only a handful of studies have been reported for highly targeted loci such as individual cis-regulatory elements28. The digital genomic footprinting approach we describe now enables genome-scale detection of the in vivo occupancy of genomic sites by DNA-binding proteins.

In addition, we computed four evolutionary conservation features for the variant base position. Specifically, we included base-level PhastCons23 scores for primates (excluding human), PhyloP24 scores for primates (excluding human), and GERP++25,26 neutral evolution and rejected substitution scores. The evolutionary conservation feature scores were downloaded from http://cadd.gs.washington.edu/. The missing values were imputed as in Kircher et al.3.
